# Salary Cap, Payroll Inequality and Competitive Advantage in MLB
Project Title: Salary Cap, Payroll Inequality and Competitive Advantage in MLB
Summary: One of the most debated questions in MLB relates to the possible implementation of a salary cap, as MLB is the only major US sport that has yet to implement a hard salary cap. 
Problem and Stakeholder:This project attempts to determine if implementing a hard salary cap in MLB will have any affect on competitive advantage for large-market teams, as there has been some speculation lately that small-market teams are left behind in free agency from star players. The Primary Stakeholder is MLB League Office (Commissioner’s Office & Competition Committee)
Data Set Overview: Time Span from 2011-2025 (15 years). Data includes average payroll per team, playoff games played per team, largest contract per team by average annual value (AAV), net worth of owner per team. Sources include Spotrac.com, Statmuse.com, and mlbtraderumors.com, all of which are widely used MLB analyst sites. 
Method: The method used is a regression analysis. Regression analysis will show more than just correlation, such as how much one variable changes when the other changes, whether the relationship is statistically significant, how strong the relationship is overall, and how well one variable predicts the other.
How to View or Reproduce: Data can be found in the file names "Ostensen_John_CP4". No further steps needed, as the regression analysis is included in the excel workbook. 
Repository Map: 1) data: File including all data and regression analysis used for the project. 2) figures: all final figures are included within the excel sheet within the folder. 3) reports: all checkpoints outlining the process, analysis, and findings.
Limitations and Next Steps: One major challenge was interpreting regression coefficients that were technically correct but practically confusing, particularly when dealing with payroll measured in raw dollars. Initially, my conclusions felt abstract and difficult to defend. I fixed this by rethinking the variable itself and introducing relative payroll in CP7. Relative payroll compared each teams payroll to the league average, where a teams relative payroll being greater than 1.00 would mean they are above average, and below 1.00 means they were below average. Another challenge was interpreting outliers, where teams who spent more money didn't make the playoffs as much. It is easy to interpret outliers on th either side (teams who didn’t spend money and had more playoff appearances) by saying they overperformed, but it was more difficult to come to the conclusion that injuries and front office performance could impact playoff appearances as well. Limits: Limits: Payroll does not capture player development efficiency or front-office quality, long-run averages may mask short-term inefficiencies or breakout seasons.
